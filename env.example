# Backend API URL (must be accessible from browser)
# Do NOT include /api at the end - it's added automatically in the code
# For production: Use your deployed backend URL (e.g., https://your-backend.vercel.app)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Note: JWT_SECRET, ADMIN_EMAIL, and ADMIN_PASSWORD should be set in the BACKEND server
# They are not needed in the frontend .env file
